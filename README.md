### Overview of Election Audit:

- The purpose of this election audit analysis was to be able to maneuver in the .csv file and to be able to take the information needed to determine various different stats. Using this .csv file I was able to determine the election results, total votes, county votes per candidate, and the largest county turnout. Using this data I was able to then calculate percentages per candidate to see their popular vote. 

### Election Audit Results

### Election Audit Summary

Election-Audit Summary:
- The programs that I worked with to calculate this data was with Python, Visual Studio Code, and Git. This script can be used with some modifications that depend on the data that the election commission is formated in. The reasons why this script would be a benifit to the election commission would be because it would automate the election results with no human error unless the code is incorrect which could be fixed easily. It would also reduce the number of people that need to work on these elections and would reduce costs when doing election votes.
